# MR Frontend Developer Technical Test

This project is a dev interview task for employment. I build an application with Next.js.

## Sample

[https://mr-task.netlify.app/](https://mr-task.netlify.app/)

## Getting started

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## CORS errors

The CORS configuration isn't set up for the provided API. I made an API endpoint with Next.js API route feature to proxy.

## Responsive Layout

I used media query to implement responsive layout for mobile client.

## CSS Modules

I made global variables for CSS styling. It helps to get more maintainability.

## To be fixed

- Unit Test
- Skeleton UI & Loading spinner
